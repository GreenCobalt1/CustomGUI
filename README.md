# CustomGUI
The customGUI plugin on Spigotmc.org. Do not upload as your own. I'm chill with you using parts of it or customizing and using as-is. No support will be provided for customized plugins unless the feature not working is completely untouched.

Code for the current version for the plugin (1.13 and up) can be found in the Current (1.13 up) folder.
Code for the current version for the plugin (1.12.2 and down) can be found in the Legacy (1.12.2 down) folder.
