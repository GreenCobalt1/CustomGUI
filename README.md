# CustomGUI
The customGUI plugin on Spigotmc.org. Do not upload as your own. I'm chill with you using parts of it or customizing and using as-is. No support will be provided for customized plugins unless the feature not working is completely untouched.

Code for the current version for the plugin (1.13 and up) can be found in the CURRENT folder.
Code for the current version for the plugin (1.12.2 and down) can be found in the Legacy LEGACY folder.

This code is from version 4.0. There might be future versions out on spigot. If you absolutely need the source for those new features and I have not updated this, decompile the one on spigot.
